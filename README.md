## Description

City Weather Tracker is a web application that provides current and future weather information for a given city. The user can search for a city by entering its name, after which the current day's weather and the next 5 days' weather (date and day of the week, temperature, max and min temperatures, wind speed, and humidity) will be displayed. The city name will also be added as a button, which the user can click to retrieve the information for the same city without having to enter the city name again.

The motivation behind this project was to provide an easy-to-use platform that can give weather information quickly and efficiently.

The problem that City Weather Tracker solves is the need for a user-friendly and efficient platform for obtaining weather information for a particular city. With this application, the user can obtain accurate and up-to-date weather information without having to navigate multiple websites or search for the information manually.

By building this project, I learned about using APIs to fetch data, using JavaScript and JQuery to manipulate the DOM, and the importance of user experience in web design.
